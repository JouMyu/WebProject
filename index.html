				Aston Martin Red Bull Racing is a Formula One racing team first racing in 2005. The cars race with a Honda produced<br> 
				V6 Hybrid Engines. The team currently races with an Austrian License, although did race under an English license from 2005 to 2006.<br>
				The team is one of two, owned by Red Bull GmbH. The other is named Scuderia AlphaTauri (previously, Scuderia Toro Rosso),<br> 
				made to promote Red Bull's clothing line. Red Bull Racing is the main team whilst Scuderia AlphaTauri is often seen<br>
				as the feeder team which provides a route into the main competitive team.

				Christian Horner has helped Red Bull Racing 8 world titles, (4 Constructors' Championships, 4 Drivers' Championships).<br>

				<p>Engine Supplier/s<p>
			</div>
			<div class = "paragraph">
				<p>The team's current engine supplier is Honda who has been supplying the team since the 2019 season.<br></p>
				<p>When the team was founded, the engine used was from Cosworth, a British engineering company, which for a short while, supplied engines to various teams<br>
				such as Lotus and Mclaren.<br></p>
				<p>In 2006 the engine supplier was from a rival team, Ferrari. This quickly changed in 2007 when Red Bull decided to switch to Renault engines.<br>
				However, after an uneventful 2015 season placing them in the lowest position in 7 years, Red Bull forced a rebranding of Renault's engines and <br>
				ran with Renault engines rebranded as TAG-Heuer. Another upset in 2018 caused Red Bull to terminate the partnership with Renault, instead opting for<bt>
				a Honda engine in 2019. Ironically, the Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo moved to race for Renault in the 2019 season on a 2 year contract until 2021</p>
